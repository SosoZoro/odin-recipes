                <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>This General Tao chicken tastes the same as the one served in Chinese restaurants, without the deep frying. The juicy meat is simmered with spices and served on steamed jasmine or basmati rice.</p>

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li></li>
                            <p>Coat chicken pieces with cornstarch in a bowl; set aside.</p>
                        <li></li>
                            <p>Beat eggs, salt, and pepper in a mixing bowl until combined. Stir in flour and baking powder until no large lumps remain. Mix in chicken pieces until evenly coated.</p>
                        <li></li>
                            <p>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over high heat. Cook chicken in hot oil until golden brown and no longer pink on the inside, about 12 minutes. Set chicken aside; keep warm.</p>
                        <li></li>
                            <p>Make sauce: Reduce heat to medium-high; add green onion, ginger, and sesame oil to the skillet. Cook and stir until onion is limp and ginger begins to brown, about 1 minute. Pour in water, sugar, and vinegar; bring to a boil.</p>
                        <li></li>
                            <p>Dissolve cornstarch in soy sauce in a small bowl and stir into vinegar mixture along with oyster sauce and ketchup. Cook until sauce has thickened and is no longer cloudy. Stir in chicken; simmer until heated through.</p>
